Nadir
=================================

**Nadir** (pronounced *nay-di-ah*) is derived from the arabic word _nazir_, and means "the lowest point of a space". In optimisation problems, it is equivalent to the point of minimum. If you are a machine learning enthusiast, a data scientist or an AI practitioner, you know how important it is to use the best optimization algorithms to train your models. The purpose of this library is to help optimize machine learning models and enable them to reach the point of nadir in the appropriate context.

**Nadir** follows the principles of Simplicity, Modularity and Composabilty. Read more in the Core Philosophy section.
